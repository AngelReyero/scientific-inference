This repo contains the code of the motivating example and the illustrative example of the paper "A Guide to Feature Importance Methods for Scientific Inference" (2024) by Fiona Katharina Ewald, Ludwig Bothmann, Marvin N. Wright, Bernd Bischl, Giuseppe Casalicchio and Gunnar König.

Most feature importance methods were computed by the Python fippy package by Gunnar König ([https://github.com/gcskoenig/fippy.git](https://github.com/gcskoenig/fippy.git)).
